# Homework 10

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of April 17 at midnight.


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to process and display a graph of the temperature and humidity inside a camera enclosure over the course of 5 days.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to create a color-changing circle which follows your mouse about the screen!

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script please!__

#### Testing
 - Auto-testing on these is more limited due to their graphical nature. In addition, I'm giving you a fair amount of flexibility in how you want to approach the problems, which makes writing any sort of automatic test difficult. As such, you are responsible for ensuring you are getting the desired output on this homework!
